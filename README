# echo3D
Generates pseudo-normals from multibeam-echosounder point clouds and the echosounder location over time.
Only useful for further surface reconstruction.

Can also color the point cloud by height (Z) and center the point cloud around (0|0|0)

#### Usage

`echo3d pointcloud.asc path.asc out.ply`

`pointcloud.asc` is an ascii file with one point per line and comma-separated x,y,z values. (MB-echosounder point cloud)<br/>
`path.asc` is an ascii file with one point per line and comma-separated x,y,z values. (location of the MB-echosounder over time)<br/>
`out.ply` is a polygon file with the generated normal and color information.<br/>

echo3d centers the point cloud around (0|0|0), generates normals and colors it by depth (Z is up).


#### Build
`cc -lm echo3d.c -o echo3d`
